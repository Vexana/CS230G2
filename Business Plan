Nutridrone is a food delivery service startup that aims to revolutionize the way food is delivered to customers. 
We are introducing a new concept of delivering food via drones, which will make the process faster and more efficient. 
Our mission is to provide customers with healthy, nutritious, and delicious meals, while also reducing delivery times and 
minimizing our carbon footprint.
Our target market is health-conscious individuals, families, and couples who want to eat nutritious meals but don't have 
the time or knowledge to plan and prepare them. We also cater to people with specific dietary needs, such as vegans, vegetarians,
and those with food allergies or intolerances. Our target market also includes those who value speed and efficiency in their food delivery.

We offer a variety of meal plans to choose from, including vegetarian, vegan, low-carb, and gluten-free options. Customers 
can select their preferred meal plan and the number of servings they require, and we will deliver the pre-portioned ingredients 
and recipe cards to their doorstep via drones. Our meals are designed by professional chefs and nutritionists, ensuring that 
they are both delicious and healthy.

We envision NutriDrone as a company that gives back to the community, working with charitable organizations and supporting causes 
that align with our values. We believe that by giving back, we can make a positive impact on society and contribute to a better world. 

What are the values we base are company upon? 
NutriDrone is to be a company that people trust and rely on, providing a service that enhances their lives and promotes healthy
living. We are committed to realizing this vision, and will continue to work tirelessly to make it a reality. 

Where did the idea come from? 
We developed the idea of NutriDrone together in a meeting. We realized that the demand for home delivery has increased significantly
over the past few years due to busy lifestyles and the convenience of shopping online. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
more and more people have been hesitant to leave their homes, leading to an increase in demand for contactless delivery services. 
So we thought of integrating an existing technology i.e. drone with home delivery, and as a result we were able to develop a more 
efficient form of the home delivery service.
