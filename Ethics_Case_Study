Item 1: Case Study 

The Cambridge Analytica case was a data scandal that emerged in 2018, involving the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica and its acquisition of data from millions of Facebook users without their knowledge or consent. The issue at the heart of the case was the unethical and potentially illegal collection of personal data by Cambridge Analytica, which was then used to create highly targeted political advertising during the 2016 US presidential election. The data was obtained through an app created by Aleksandr Kogan, a data scientist and app developer who sold it to Cambridge Analytica. As a result of the scandal, Facebook came under intense scrutiny for its handling of user data, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg being called to testify before the US Congress. Cambridge Analytica ultimately went bankrupt, while Kogan and Wylie faced legal action over their role in the data collection [1].
In terms of the personal ethical frameworks of the stakeholders involved, there were a range of actions and decisions taken. For Cambridge Analytica, the pursuit of profit and political influence appeared to take precedence over ethical considerations around data privacy and informed consent. Kogan and Wylie may have been motivated by financial gain or a desire to expose unethical practices, but their actions in collecting and selling user data without permission were also highly questionable. For Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook, the ethical framework around data privacy and user consent was more ambiguous. While the company claimed to value user privacy and data protection, it also sought to maximize profits and leverage user data for advertising purposes. The resulting scandal forced the company to reevaluate its policies and practices around data privacy [2]. Finally, for consumers, the Cambridge Analytica case highlighted the need for greater awareness and control over their personal data. While some users may have been willing to share their data with the app in exchange for a personality quiz or other features, they were likely unaware of the scale and implications of the data collection. The case prompted a broader conversation around data privacy and the responsibility of companies and individuals to protect personal information.


Item 2: Personal Ethics

The evaluation of the scandal's impact on one's personal code of ethics entails comparing one's own moral principles 
and values to those of the people and organizations engaged in the scandal. It is essential to assess one's own personal
code of ethics to determine how these actions align with personal values. The scandal may raise questions about the ethical
implications of the actions done by the individuals and companies involved. According to Lucas and Fyke (2014)[3], moral
reasoning is a process that is involved in making ethical decisions because it considers both the ethical ideals and possible
outcomes of actions. Individuals may give some ideals more weight than others, which influences how they make ethical decisions.
As a result, it's crucial to take into account how one's personal values and beliefs may affect how they perceive the scandal's
ethical ramifications. Additionally, since these elements may also affect how ethical conduct is perceived, ethical evaluations
should take into account the larger societal and cultural context in which the scandal occurred. People can better understand
their own ethical standards and how they pertain to the actions in the scandal by conducting a personal code of ethics evaluation.

We all believe that the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica Data Scandal highlights serious issues regarding privacy, consent, and transparency
from an ethical perspective. Individuals have a right to privacy and should be in charge of their confidential information.
There are significant ethical questions raised by the reality that user data was collected without users' permission.
Furthermore, we believe it is obviously unethical to use confidential information for political advertising without user consent, 
as this goes against ethical standards of accountability and transparency. The scandal also emphasizes the necessity for 
people to be conscious of their online data and take precautions to protect their privacy. As individuals, it is our duty
to understand how our data is gathered and used, and to take precautions to safeguard our internet privacy.

Item 3: Professional Ethics 
In discussing the Professional Ethics for our case study, "Federal Trade Commission vs Facebook Cambridge Analytica", 
we can apply the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct to analyze this case. The ACM Code of Ethics expresses 
the conscience of the computing profession and is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all computing 
professionals [1]. One specific principle from the ACM Code of Ethics that I believe applies to this case can be found
in item 1.1, which states that a computing professional should “Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging
that all people are stakeholders in computing” [1]. This principle affirms an obligation of computing professionals to use 
their skills for the benefit of society and its members, including promoting fundamental human rights and protecting all 
individual’s right to autonomy [1]. In this case, the Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint against
one of the widely known and huge data analytics company-- Cambridge Analytica, alleging that they have engaged in deceptive 
tactics to gather personal information from tens of millions of Facebook user to be used for voter profiling and targeting 
[2]. This action is not only very controversial but also portrays the violation of the principle stated above as it did not
contribute to society or human well-being and did not protect individuals’ right to autonomy. Based on this principle from 
the ACM Code of Ethics, the right course of action would have been for Cambridge Analytica to act responsibly and transparently
in their data collection practices, ensuring that they were not deceiving users or violating their privacy.


Personal ethics discusses the evaluation of a scandal's impact on one's personal code of ethics, while professional ethics discusses the application of a specific code of ethics, the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, to a case study. Both personal and professional ethics are similar in emphasizing the importance of ethical principles and values in decision making. However, the first person ethics is more general and discusses the importance of evaluating personal values and beliefs when making ethical decisions. On the other hand, the personal ethic is more specific, focusing on the application of a particular code of ethics to a specific case study. Personal ethics also highlights the responsibility of computing professionals to contribute to society and promote human well-being, which is not explicitly stated in personal ethics. This emphasizes the importance of professional ethics and the impact of ethical decisions on society as a whole, rather than just on an individual's personal code of ethics.
In conclusion, both personal and professional ethics stress the importance of ethical principles and values in decision making. However, professional ethics provides a more specific and concrete example of how a particular code of ethics can be applied to a real life situation, highlighting the importance of professional ethics and the impact of ethical decisions on society.
