What are the values we base are company upon? 

NutriDrone is to be a company that people trust and rely on, providing a service that enhances their lives and promotes 
healthy living. We are committed to realizing this vision, and will continue to work tirelessly to make it a reality. 

Where did the idea come from? 

We developed the idea of NutriDrone together in a meeting. We realized that the demand for home delivery has increased 
significantly over the past few years due to busy lifestyles and the convenience of shopping online. With the onset of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more people have been hesitant to leave their homes, leading to an increase in demand for 
contactless delivery services. So we thought of integrating an existing technology i.e. drone with home delivery, and as a 
result we were able to develop a more efficient form of the home delivery service.
