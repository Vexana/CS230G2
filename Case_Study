Item 3: Professional Ethics 
In discussing the Professional Ethics for our case study, "Federal Trade Commission vs Facebook Cambridge Analytica", we can apply the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct to analyze this case. The ACM Code of Ethics expresses the conscience of the computing profession and is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all computing professionals [1]. One specific principle from the ACM Code of Ethics that I believe applies to this case can be found in item 1.1, which states that a computing professional should “Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing” [1]. This principle affirms an obligation of computing professionals to use their skills for the benefit of society and its members, including promoting fundamental human rights and protecting all individual’s right to autonomy [1]. In this case, the Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint against one of the widely known and huge data analytics company-- Cambridge Analytica, alleging that they have engaged in deceptive tactics to gather personal information from tens of millions of Facebook user to be used for voter profiling and targeting [2]. This action is not only very controversial but also portrays the violation of the principle stated above as it did not contribute to society or human well-being and did not protect individuals’ right to autonomy. Based on this principle from the ACM Code of Ethics, the right course of action would have been for Cambridge Analytica to act responsibly and transparently in their data collection practices, ensuring that they were not deceiving users or violating their privacy.
